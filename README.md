# ProfileExtractor
Program to easily extract player profiles using Epic Games API. Made for personal use.

> Device code generation and some functions is based on xMistt's [DeviceAuthGenerator](https://github.com/xMistt/DeviceAuthGenerator) project. But this program does not generate any device auths. Retrieves the player profiles using the user's access token.

After completing the authorization, select a player profile and the program will download it to the `/profiles` folder for you.
